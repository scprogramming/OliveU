    <h1>Getting Started with Python</h1>
    <h6 class="articleh6"><strong>Author:</strong> Scott Cosentino</h6>

        <p>Python is a high-level interpreted programming language. Let’s break down this definition to understand better what that means. A programming language is a language that can be used to write programs for a computer. A high-level language lets programmers write programs without needing to worry about the details of how the computer runs and stores the program. This abstraction of detail makes it easier to write programs but sacrifices some efficiency. Most programmers work in high-level languages. However, some domains, like system programming, use more low-level languages. With any programming language, your code must be translated into machine code so your CPU can understand and execute the code. There are two main approaches to this translation. The first approach is called compiling. With compiling, all the code associated with a program is translated into machine code. This creates an executable file that can be run on the target computer. The second approach is called interpretation. With interpreted languages like Python, program code is run directly and translated into machine code as it runs. </p>

        <p>To be able to write Python code, the first thing you need to do is download an interpreter. You can download Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. You will be able to download an installer for your operating system and install it as you would any other program. Python installs various components, but we are mainly interested in two components: the Python interpreter and IDLE. </p>
        
        <h2>Python Interactive Mode</h2>
        <p>You can access Python in interactive mode by typing <em>python</em> into your computer command line. You will see an output like the following image.</p>

        <img class="centerImage" src="assets/images/CS101/articles/GettingStartedWithPython_Interactive1.jpg">
        <p>Interactive mode allows you to execute code one line at a time by typing the code into the command line. For example, type the line print(“Hello!”). You will see the text Hello printed on the screen.</p>

        <p>The interactive mode of Python is ideal for situations where you want to test some code to see the result quickly. The Python command can also be used to run code that is stored in a file. To see this, exit interactive mode by typing <em>quit()</em>.</p>
        
        <h2>Running Code in Files</h2>
        <p>To see how Python can run code in a file, create a file somewhere on your computer. I will create my file in <em>C:\source\test\</em> and name the file <em>test.py</em>. The <em>.py</em> extension is the typical file extension used for Python programs. Inside the file, write the code <em>print(“Hello!”)</em>. Save the file, then open your command line. To run your code, run <em>python yourFileNameHere</em>. For example, my file is named <em>test.py</em>, so I use the command <em>python test.py</em>. You will see the code result in your command line.</p>

        <p>This method of running code is ideal for larger projects and projects that need to be run multiple times. Writing code in text files is easy enough when you have a small program, but it is helpful to have more powerful tools for bigger projects. We often use an IDE, or integrated development environment, for writing programs. An IDE provides tools for writing and debugging code, making it easier to write working programs. The best IDE to use is really a subjective choice. Python comes with an IDE named IDLE, which provides some basic IDE functionality. I prefer to use PyCharm for my personal projects, which I will primarily demonstrate with. To download PyCharm, navigate to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">the JetBrains website</a>. This site will provide an installer for each operating system and instructions for installing PyCharm. </p>

        <h2>Basics of PyCharm</h2>

        <p>When launching PyCharm, you will be prompted to open or create a project. Select New Project to create a Python project. </p>        

        <img class="centerImage" src="assets/images/CS101/articles/GettingStartedWithPython_PyCharm1.jpg">

        <p>When you create a new project, you will be asked for a location to store the project. Select any location you want to use for saving code on your computer. The second section will ask you to create a virtual environment for Python. PyCharm creates a unique Python interpreter for each project you create. This allows you to change configurations for your project without affecting other programs that use Python on your computer. The base interpreter should point to your python.exe file. The following image shows a sample project setup for PyCharm. </p>

        <p>When you create your project, you will be redirected to the main project window. On the left, you will see all of the files in your project.</p>

        <img class="centerImage" src="assets/images/CS101/articles/GettingStartedWithPython_PyCharm3.jpg">

        <p> To create a new file in your project, right click on the top folder, then select new. For example, I would right-click the test folder to create a new file. You will be able to create new Python files and other files as needed. To open a file, double-click on it in the left project sidebar. When you do this, the file contents will show in the middle window of PyCharm.</p>

        <img class="centerImage" src="assets/images/CS101/articles/GettingStartedWithPython_PyCharm4.jpg">

        <p>To run the program, select the green play button in the top right of PyCharm. The dropdown next to the play button lets you select which file you want to run. By default, this is set to the current file, which will run the file currently open in the main window.</p>

        <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
        This gets you up and running with PyCharm. You can do much more in the IDE, and we will explore some features like debugging in future articles. For now, you are ready to start learning to write Python code!
