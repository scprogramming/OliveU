        <p>Before discussing how to program, we should define what exactly a program is. Computers can perform various tasks, ranging from mathematics to word processing. 
            To get the computer to do something, we need to instruct it. 
            A program is a set of instructions a computer follows to perform a task. 
            A programmer is simply a person who writes programs. 
            And so, if you are learning how to program, you are learning how to write instructions for a computer. 
            Before you start learning how to write programs, it is helpful to understand how a computer executes programs. 
            Let’s look at how a computer works at a high level.
        </p>

        <h2>Hardware and Software</h2>
        <p>Hardware refers to all the physical devices or components of a computer. For example, a keyboard, mouse, and monitor are all hardware. Specifically, the keyboard, mouse, and monitor are examples of I/O devices or input output devices. An input device allows you to provide data to the computer, and an output device lets you see data that the computer produces. Input and output are core components of the computer. Being able to provide input allows you to interact with computers and programs. Without input devices, you wouldn’t be able to write programs for the computer. Output devices let you see results generated by the computer so you can interpret the results it generates. </p>

        <p>When a computer receives some inputs, it needs to be able to process the data. There are three main components involved in processing data and instructions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The central processing unit (CPU)</li>
            <li>Main memory (RAM)</li>
            <li>Secondary storage devices</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The CPU is the most critical component of a computer. Generally, a CPU is a small chip called a microprocessor. This microprocessor is responsible for fetching an instruction from memory, executing it, and storing the result of the execution. The memory from which the CPU fetches instructions is the main memory or RAM. RAM can be seen as a computer’s working area. Your computer will store programs and data in the RAM, allowing the CPU to fetch each instruction of the program to execute them. RAM is a volatile storage form, meaning it is cleared when the computer is powered off. To store data more permanently, a secondary storage device is used. Secondary storage devices include components like hard drives and solid-state drives. Programs are stored in secondary storage when they are not running and move into RAM when they are running.</p>

        <p>With this basic understanding of computer hardware, we can now discuss software. Software is simply another name for programs. We generally divide software into two categories: system and application.  System software controls the basic operations of a computer. System software includes software like operating systems and the utility programs they use to function. Application software includes software that makes a computer useful for everyday tasks. You likely run these programs daily: mail programs, web browsers, etc. When you first start learning programming, you will work with application software. Once you have a good handle on application software, you can dive into the world of system software.</p>

        <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
        <p>You now have a basic understanding of a computer and how it runs programs! You can continue learning the basics of programming by reading <a href="tutorials/CS101/how-computers-store-data">How Computers Store Data.</a></p>
